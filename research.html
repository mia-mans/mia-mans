				<p>THE MILKY WAY SYSTEM

			</div>
			<div class="paragraph1">
				<span class="bold">All galaxies have </span>
				satellite galaxies that orbit, fall into, and 
				otherwise interact with their host galaxy. Our Milky Way 
				galaxy has one satellite of note: the Large Magellanic 
				Cloud, or LMC. The LMC is a massive satellite estimated 
				to be roughly 10-20% of the Milky Way’s mass. As a 
				result, its interactions with the Milky Way have a 
				significant impact on the kinematic structure of the 
				Milky Way.
				<br>
				<br>
			</div>

			<div class="paragraph2">
				The dynamic features of Milky Way-LMC interactions 
				can be separated into a local and a global effect on 
				the Milky Way. While the expected effects are well 
				understood, the existing observational data is not 
				dense enough to accurately identify any perturbations. 
				However, emerging asteroseismic methods provide a 
				promising solution. Asteroseismic distances from M 
				giant stars will provide an unprecedented look into 
				the outer regions of the Milky Way and the effects of 
				the LMC. 
				<br>
				<br>
			</div>

			<div class="paragraph3">
				In order to prepare for upcoming asteroseismic catalogs, 
				I’ve worked with Dr. Robyn Sanderson, Dr. Daniel Huber, 
				and Daniel Hey to identify signatures of massive 
				satellite interactions in FIRE-2 cosmological simulations
				 and predict their observability in mock stellar surveys
				  using py-ananke. We are able to isolate a strong local 
				  signature in the simulation host galaxy, and are 
				  working to identify the signal in RR Lyrae and 
				  M giant mock surveys.

				This project began through the REU program at the 
				University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy. See 
				my 2023 talk and 2023 AAS iPoster on this work.
